# Genshin Impact NFT Project

This project consists of the code used by me to create the genshin impact NFTs. The user first heads to the web app then collects their metamask wallet. After the user decides to mint the NFT, he will get a confirmation message on their device to use test Ethereum to mint a random NFT. The frameworks and tools used for this project are VS code, react.js, node.js, hardhat, OpenZepplin, Alchemy and Metamask.

Thank you for your time!
