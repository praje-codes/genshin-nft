# Genshin Impact NFT Project

This project consists of the code used by me to create the genshin impact NFTs. The user first heads to the web app then collects their metamask wallet, which should have an account that is connected to Rinkeby Network. After the user decides to mint the NFT, he will get a confirmation message on their device to use test Ethereum to mint a random NFT. The frameworks and tools used for this project are VS code, react.js, node.js, hardhat, OpenZepplin, Alchemy and Metamask. For privacy and fraud reasons I have not pushed the .env file.

I'll be updating this overtime until I find it perfect.

Thank you for your time!
